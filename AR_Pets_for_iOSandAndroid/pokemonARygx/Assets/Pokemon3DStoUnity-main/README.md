- Add two new layers called "FireCore" and "FireMask"

- Either create a new ForwardRenderer (sample attached in root of this repo), or select your existing ForwardRenderer
- The default ForwardRenderer will be with URP settings in `Assets/Setting`
- In the ForwardRenderer: From Opaque Layer Mask remove FireCore and FireMask.
- Add two render objects one for each layer, for their individual settings refer the image below
- In your project settings. (URP Renderer Settings) If you created a new ForwardRenderer, set the new one as default

What does the package do at the moment:
-
- Open the Binary using SPICA's H3D parser
- Translate the 3D model to Unity Mesh system and skinned mesh renderers
- Generate material files from the textures 
- Automatically copy over some of the shader settings to the newly created materials
- Skins and generates the skeleton for the mesh
- Generates skeletal animations from the binaries
- Generate material / vis animations and append them to skeletal animations
- Renames animations, skips repeated animations
- Saves the translated mon as prefab
- Supports bulk processing

Updating:
-
- Unity package manager doesn't currently support version of git packages, for now just remove the project as a dependency and add it again
